0:00:01,600 --> 0:00:03,967
(male narrator)
Previously, on a very special
Clone High:


2
0:00:03,967 --> 0:00:05,533
Tempers flared,


3
0:00:05,533 --> 0:00:07,633
robotic butlers cared,


4
0:00:07,633 --> 0:00:09,667
saliva was shared,


5
0:00:09,667 --> 0:00:13,833
and you, the audience,
were moved very, very deeply.


6
0:00:13,833 --> 0:00:14,833
**


7
0:00:14,833 --> 0:00:16,400
[whispering]
Trust me.


8
0:00:16,400 --> 0:00:19,033
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s


9
0:00:19,033 --> 0:00:21,967
* Secret government employees


10
0:00:21,967 --> 0:00:24,867
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *


11
0:00:24,867 --> 0:00:27,900
* And made amusing
genetic copies *


12
0:00:27,900 --> 0:00:30,700
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *


13
0:00:30,700 --> 0:00:33,533
* They're going to make it
if they try *


14
0:00:33,533 --> 0:00:36,533
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *


15
0:00:36,533 --> 0:00:42,767
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *


16
0:00:42,767 --> 0:00:45,500
* Clone High


17
0:00:45,500 --> 0:00:51,200
* Clone High


18
0:00:51,200 --> 0:00:52,433
*


19
0:00:52,433 --> 0:00:54,500
All students are special
at Clone High,


20
0:00:54,500 --> 0:00:56,467
but only some students
are ostracized


21
0:00:56,467 --> 0:00:58,200
because they're special.


22
0:00:58,200 --> 0:01:00,267
That is why it is
my great pleasure,


23
0:01:00,267 --> 0:01:01,900
as president
of the student body,


24
0:01:01,900 --> 0:01:04,233
to officially dedicate
this impassable moat,


25
0:01:04,233 --> 0:01:06,367
protecting us from
the special ed. classroom.


26
0:01:06,367 --> 0:01:07,767
[applause]


27
0:01:07,767 --> 0:01:10,800
Surprised Cleopatra didn't
fill the moat with acid.


28
0:01:10,800 --> 0:01:13,433
Actually, Cleo says it
would kill the piranhas.


29
0:01:13,433 --> 0:01:15,267
Joan of Arc, don't think
about the moat


30
0:01:15,267 --> 0:01:17,300
in terms of its
divisive ignorance,


31
0:01:17,300 --> 0:01:19,967
think of it as an opportunity
for building community.


32
0:01:19,967 --> 0:01:21,100
Hey, community!


33
0:01:21,100 --> 0:01:22,233
Skinny-dipping in
the piranha moat!


34
0:01:22,233 --> 0:01:23,233
Yow!


35
0:01:23,233 --> 0:01:25,833
Everybody get
naked!


36
0:01:25,833 --> 0:01:27,467
Whoo!
[splash]


37
0:01:27,467 --> 0:01:28,867
Finally,


38
0:01:28,867 --> 0:01:31,500
I won't be running
for re-election this year.


39
0:01:31,500 --> 0:01:33,200
[voice breaking]
This is probably
the last time


40
0:01:33,200 --> 0:01:36,500
I'll ever use these oversized
novelty scissors.


41
0:01:36,500 --> 0:01:39,833
Unless a giant
needs a haircut.


42
0:01:39,833 --> 0:01:41,467
Oh, God.


43
0:01:41,467 --> 0:01:43,600
I've got to go
console her.


44
0:01:43,600 --> 0:01:44,767
Abe Lincoln, don't.


45
0:01:44,767 --> 0:01:46,067
She's just trying
to get attention


46
0:01:46,067 --> 0:01:47,633
and you're falling for it.


47
0:01:47,633 --> 0:01:50,333
Ugh, it makes me so mad
I could kiss you.


48
0:01:50,333 --> 0:01:52,533
What was that
last part?


49
0:01:52,533 --> 0:01:53,967
I'm sorry, what?


50
0:01:53,967 --> 0:01:57,533
[stammering]
No, I said I could piss glue.


51
0:01:57,533 --> 0:01:58,900
As in,


52
0:01:58,900 --> 0:02:01,900
"Oh, I'm so angry
I could piss glue."


53
0:02:01,900 --> 0:02:03,133
I've never
heard of that.


54
0:02:03,133 --> 0:02:04,167
Well, it's a very common
expression.


55
0:02:04,167 --> 0:02:05,333
Huh.


56
0:02:05,333 --> 0:02:07,667
Well,
see ya.


57
0:02:07,667 --> 0:02:08,667
[exhales]


58
0:02:08,667 --> 0:02:10,600
Stupid, Joan.


59
0:02:10,600 --> 0:02:11,600
Real stupid.


60
0:02:11,600 --> 0:02:12,767
[piranhas chomping]


61
0:02:12,767 --> 0:02:13,867
[plop]


62
0:02:13,867 --> 0:02:16,900
[sobbing]
Oh, JFK.


63
0:02:16,900 --> 0:02:18,700
I can't bear
to talk about it.


64
0:02:18,700 --> 0:02:20,333
Thank God, because I
hate it when--


65
0:02:20,333 --> 0:02:22,300
It all started
freshman year.


66
0:02:22,300 --> 0:02:25,067
I was elected
president.


67
0:02:25,067 --> 0:02:27,067
But now...


68
0:02:27,067 --> 0:02:28,633
[sobbing]
Oh, JFK.


69
0:02:28,633 --> 0:02:30,067
There, there.


70
0:02:30,067 --> 0:02:31,933
It's term limits,
Jack.


71
0:02:31,933 --> 0:02:34,500
Dirty, dirty
term limits.


72
0:02:34,500 --> 0:02:35,933
[cheery]
My only hope is if someone,


73
0:02:35,933 --> 0:02:36,933
and I have
no idea who,


74
0:02:36,933 --> 0:02:38,167
could run for president,
win,


75
0:02:38,167 --> 0:02:39,433
abolish term limits,
resign,


76
0:02:39,433 --> 0:02:40,967
and endorse me as his
replacement.


77
0:02:40,967 --> 0:02:42,200
But who?


78
0:02:42,200 --> 0:02:43,267
Who?


79
0:02:43,267 --> 0:02:44,267
Huh?


80
0:02:44,267 --> 0:02:46,500
Oh, thank you, JFK.


81
0:02:46,500 --> 0:02:48,867
Thank you
for your courage.


82
0:02:48,867 --> 0:02:50,667
Can we make out now?


83
0:02:50,667 --> 0:02:53,300
Totally.


84
0:02:53,300 --> 0:02:54,800
[moaning]


85
0:02:54,800 --> 0:02:56,167
Hey, Cleo.


86
0:02:56,167 --> 0:02:57,600
[Cleopatra and JFK making out]


87
0:02:57,600 --> 0:02:59,667
Oh.


88
0:02:59,667 --> 0:03:03,900
(Principal Scudworth)
Your secret army
of clone historical figures


89
0:03:03,900 --> 0:03:06,500
is maturing according
to schedule.


90
0:03:06,500 --> 0:03:08,200
I'm sorry, Scudworth,
is that a scale model


91
0:03:08,200 --> 0:03:10,200
behind you labeled
"Dr. Scudworth's Evil Plan"?


92
0:03:12,333 --> 0:03:13,667
Say!


93
0:03:13,667 --> 0:03:15,800
Where'd you get those
fresh Pumas, bro?


94
0:03:15,800 --> 0:03:18,067
Actually, we're sponsored
by Puma.


95
0:03:18,067 --> 0:03:20,667
These bad boys
are catalogue only.


96
0:03:20,667 --> 0:03:22,433
If you're implying
that I intend


97
0:03:22,433 --> 0:03:24,067
to steal the clones
away from you


98
0:03:24,067 --> 0:03:26,633
and use them in an expensive
clone theme amusement park,


99
0:03:26,633 --> 0:03:28,067
then shame on you.


100
0:03:28,067 --> 0:03:30,100
By the by,
could I have $2 million?


101
0:03:31,333 --> 0:03:33,933
[laughs]
You know...


102
0:03:33,933 --> 0:03:35,967
for dry-erase markers
and such.


103
0:03:35,967 --> 0:03:37,767
They've got some
keen new colors.


104
0:03:37,767 --> 0:03:40,467
There's kiwi and...


105
0:03:40,467 --> 0:03:41,733
mango.


106
0:03:41,733 --> 0:03:44,067
For giggles, I'm going
to keep saying "no"


107
0:03:44,067 --> 0:03:45,600
until you
turn the TV off.


108
0:03:45,600 --> 0:03:47,800
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no--


109
0:03:47,800 --> 0:03:48,833
[electronic whirring]


110
0:03:49,900 --> 0:03:51,067
[sighs]


111
0:03:51,067 --> 0:03:52,533
Perhaps you could get


112
0:03:52,533 --> 0:03:54,933
Clone High
a corporate sponsor.


113
0:03:54,933 --> 0:03:58,133
Those Pumas
were rather fresh.


114
0:03:58,133 --> 0:03:59,200
Sell out?


115
0:03:59,200 --> 0:04:00,633
And turn the school
into an ad


116
0:04:00,633 --> 0:04:03,200
for some profit-hungry
corporation?


117
0:04:03,200 --> 0:04:04,967
Why, that idea's
as foolish


118
0:04:04,967 --> 0:04:09,833
as getting new brakes
from anywhere but Midas.


119
0:04:09,833 --> 0:04:13,200
(Joan)
I can't believe JFK
is running unopposed.


120
0:04:13,200 --> 0:04:15,733
I mean, you'd think with
a school full of world leaders


121
0:04:15,733 --> 0:04:17,600
someone would be into
student government.


122
0:04:17,600 --> 0:04:19,967
Well, I'm a genetic duplicate
of Abe Lincoln


123
0:04:19,967 --> 0:04:21,267
and I'm not fit
to be president.


124
0:04:21,267 --> 0:04:23,100
If I only knew
what fears


125
0:04:23,100 --> 0:04:25,367
and insecurities
were holding me back.


126
0:04:25,367 --> 0:04:26,967
[slurping]


127
0:04:26,967 --> 0:04:28,100
Abe, you should run.


128
0:04:28,100 --> 0:04:29,500
I'll manage your campaign.


129
0:04:29,500 --> 0:04:31,567
Together, we'll fight
for things that really matter,


130
0:04:31,567 --> 0:04:33,367
like new bishops
for the chess club.


131
0:04:33,367 --> 0:04:34,867
So what you're
saying is,


132
0:04:34,867 --> 0:04:37,533
if I run for president,
I can get Cleo to like me.


133
0:04:37,533 --> 0:04:39,067
That's why
she likes JFK,


134
0:04:39,067 --> 0:04:40,500
because he's
a natural leader.


135
0:04:40,500 --> 0:04:42,967
Great idea, Joan.


136
0:04:42,967 --> 0:04:43,967
[yells]


137
0:04:43,967 --> 0:04:45,567
[crash]


138
0:04:45,567 --> 0:04:46,800
Clumsy, Joan.


139
0:04:46,800 --> 0:04:49,300
Really clumsy.


140
0:04:49,300 --> 0:04:50,300
(Scudworth)
So...


141
0:04:50,300 --> 0:04:52,167
your product is called--


142
0:04:52,167 --> 0:04:53,400
X-Stream Blu!


143
0:04:53,400 --> 0:04:54,733
It's a power snack!


144
0:04:54,733 --> 0:04:56,467
Stick it in
your face hole!


145
0:04:56,467 --> 0:04:57,733
This is something
you eat?


146
0:04:57,733 --> 0:04:59,367
[whispering]
It's really just pancake batter


147
0:04:59,367 --> 0:05:00,900
mixed with blue house paint
in a sports bottle.


148
0:05:00,900 --> 0:05:01,900
Sick!
Tight!


149
0:05:01,900 --> 0:05:03,233
Cyber awesome!


150
0:05:04,867 --> 0:05:06,200
I see.


151
0:05:06,200 --> 0:05:07,900
Now, for allowing you
to test market


152
0:05:07,900 --> 0:05:09,700
this X-Stream Blu
on my students,


153
0:05:09,700 --> 0:05:12,567
I am willing to be paid
$2 million.


154
0:05:12,567 --> 0:05:14,100
Allow me to confer
with my associates.

0:05:14,100 --> 0:05:15,133
[screams]


156
0:05:15,133 --> 0:05:16,667
- To the max!
- Literally!


157
0:05:16,667 --> 0:05:19,100
I have low
self-esteem!


158
0:05:20,433 --> 0:05:21,933
We accept
your offer.


159
0:05:21,933 --> 0:05:24,167
[gasps]
Dead presidents, Mr. B.


160
0:05:24,167 --> 0:05:25,667
[squeaks]

0:05:25,667 --> 0:05:28,200
(JFK)
Ask not what
your student body president


162
0:05:28,200 --> 0:05:29,600
can do for you,


163
0:05:29,600 --> 0:05:31,333
ask what you can do


164
0:05:31,333 --> 0:05:33,567
to your
student body president's body.


165
0:05:33,567 --> 0:05:34,867
[cheering]


166
0:05:34,867 --> 0:05:36,567
Okay, there's nothing
to worry about.


167
0:05:36,567 --> 0:05:38,167
He's just making
empty promises


168
0:05:38,167 --> 0:05:39,867
and detailing
his workout routine.


169
0:05:39,867 --> 0:05:43,267
And on Fridays,
I do abs and legs,


170
0:05:43,267 --> 0:05:45,433
but not calves.


171
0:05:45,433 --> 0:05:47,067
As you recall,


172
0:05:47,067 --> 0:05:51,500
I do those with my lats
on Wednesdays!


173
0:05:51,500 --> 0:05:52,500
[cheering]


174
0:05:52,500 --> 0:05:53,500
Thank you!


175
0:05:53,500 --> 0:05:54,633
Good luck.

and I'm running
for student body president.

(woman screaming)
I love you, JFK!


181
0:06:11,700 --> 0:06:15,067
We've got a lot of tough issues
facing us right now,


182
0:06:15,067 --> 0:06:18,333
such as adding a second section
of AP calculus


183
0:06:18,333 --> 0:06:20,867
for those who have a conflict
between that class


184
0:06:20,867 --> 0:06:22,533
and AP physics.

Hey, everyone!

0:06:46,467 --> 0:06:48,100
I'm Tyler,
that's Paco,


197
0:06:48,100 --> 0:06:49,800
and we want you to
get up out of your seats


198
0:06:49,800 --> 0:06:52,067
and clap your hands
to the beat.

'Cause we're gonna tell you
about X-Stream Blu,

a new max wicked food product


202
0:06:57,533 --> 0:06:59,733
that lives where
extreme meets blue.


203
0:06:59,733 --> 0:07:03,967
It comes in a totally sick
wide-mouth squeeze bottle!

so good!

0:07:10,300 --> 0:07:11,300
What's in it?


209
0:07:11,300 --> 0:07:13,067
Great question!

That totally
answers my question!

0:07:19,400 --> 0:07:22,433
Man, the audience
was not having that.


214
0:07:22,433 --> 0:07:23,433
Huh, guys?


215
0:07:23,433 --> 0:07:24,800
Um, Abe?


216
0:07:24,800 --> 0:07:27,433
Just give me a few
more minutes of denial.

0:07:39,900 --> 0:07:41,067
Abe, Abe,


219
0:07:41,067 --> 0:07:42,967
your speech wasn't
that bad.


220
0:07:42,967 --> 0:07:45,633
Okay, maybe the encore
wasn't the best idea,


221
0:07:45,633 --> 0:07:46,633
but the speech
itself--


222
0:07:46,633 --> 0:07:47,633
Whoo!


223
0:07:47,633 --> 0:07:48,933
What stinks
in here, man?


224
0:07:48,933 --> 0:07:51,067
Oh yeah,
it's your campaign.


225
0:07:51,067 --> 0:07:52,467
You died out there.


226
0:07:52,467 --> 0:07:54,633
I mean, that assembly was like
this, boom, this!


227
0:07:54,633 --> 0:07:55,767
You're the boom.

No matter how hard I try


230
0:07:58,800 --> 0:08:01,067
to live up
to the real Abe Lincoln,


231
0:08:01,067 --> 0:08:02,400
I always fail.


232
0:08:02,400 --> 0:08:03,400
Hey, don't worry,
man.


233
0:08:03,400 --> 0:08:04,867
Your problems
are answered.


234
0:08:04,867 --> 0:08:07,233
See, I met these really cool
guys after the assembly


235
0:08:07,233 --> 0:08:08,600
that will so get you.

the googly to the max!

(all)
Hot sauce!


243
0:08:20,800 --> 0:08:22,800
See, they want
to sponsor your campaign.


244
0:08:22,800 --> 0:08:25,267
And all you gotta do
is abandon your values


245
0:08:25,267 --> 0:08:26,633
and promote
their product


246
0:08:26,633 --> 0:08:29,267
by doing some dangerous, extreme
sports-related stunts.


247
0:08:29,267 --> 0:08:31,333
Just sign this legit-ass
contract!

And totally initial
article seven.

0:08:33,167 --> 0:08:36,100
My son won't even look me
in the eye anymore!


250

Wait, what about
the issues, Abe?


251
0:08:39,300 --> 0:08:41,433
What about the carpet
in the library?


252
0:08:41,433 --> 0:08:43,433
[mocking]
Ooh, Abe's big choice.


253
0:08:43,433 --> 0:08:44,533
Ooh,
I wonder what it'll be.


254
0:08:44,533 --> 0:08:46,600

Let's go surf
the Internet!


275
0:09:19,133 --> 0:09:21,100
What should we do
with all this X-Stream Blu?


276
0:09:21,100 --> 0:09:22,800
(Abraham and Blushie)
Spray it in your face

did you say I was winning?

man.

I need someone
to comfort me.

leading the polls


296
0:09:56,533 --> 0:09:58,600
and is named Abe.

0:09:58,600 --> 0:10:01,167
Wait,
you're named Abe.


298

him over my bed are coming down.

where he's under the tree

Bling, bling.


308
0:10:20,700 --> 0:10:23,200
But shouldn't you be saving
some of this money


309
0:10:23,200 --> 0:10:26,033
for your secret plan instead
of having me gold plated


310
0:10:26,033 --> 0:10:27,933
and lowered?


311
0:10:27,933 --> 0:10:29,900
Don't get all up in my business,


312
0:10:29,900 --> 0:10:32,300

friend.


313
0:10:32,300 --> 0:10:34,067
Why, I watched the first 2/3

0:10:34,067 --> 0:10:35,967
of the MC Hammer
Behind the Music.


315
0:10:35,967 --> 0:10
And if there's one thing
I've learned about money,


316
0:10 --> 0:10:41,367
it's that it never runs out.


317
0:10:41,367 --> 0:10:45,267
(JFK)
Hey, gay foster dads.


318
0:10:45,267 --> 0:10:47,767
How do I get everyone
to like me?


319
0:10:47,767 --> 0:10:51,467
Baby, a lot of people
liked the original JFK


320
0:10:51,467 --> 0:10:53,167
because he was
such a caring leader


321
0:10:53,167 --> 0:10:55,600
and he inspired
a generation of young people.


322
0:10:55,600 --> 0:10:59,367
I thought he was
a macho womanizing stud


323
0:10:59,367 --> 0:11:01,100
who conquered the moon.

for the next 15 minutes.

Would you shut up?


337
0:11:25,467 --> 0:11:28,167
I'm here because I can't stand
Abe being Cleo's puppet


338
0:11:28,167 --> 0:11:30,067
and you can't win the election
without my help.

we're gonna do...

outrageous campaign stunt,

I will ride this wind surfboard,

by a bungee cord

0:11:54,300 --> 0:11:56,167

0:11:56,167 --> 0:11:58,500

would've done,

Honest Abe.

0:12:23,500 --> 0:12:25,667
Or so he'd have you believe.


367
0:12:25,667 --> 0:12:28,800
Last year, Abe said
he was 15 years old.


368
0:12:28,800 --> 0:12:31,433
Now he claims to be 16.


369

Which is it, Abe?

He'd also like you to believe
he's not a baby eater.

But he's never gone on record
saying he isn't.


374
0:12:40,567 --> 0:12:43,400
Maybe he's too busy
eating babies.


375

Not voting for Abe:


383
0:12:54,733 --> 0:12:56,733
it just makes sense.


384
0:12:56,733 --> 0:12:59,767
How did JFK get
my spaghetti video?


385
0:13:02,700 --> 0:13:05,067
[dramatic music]

[whooshing]


387
0:13:07,567 --> 0:13:09,733
Hey, turn that frown
upside down, Abe.


388
0:13:09,733 --> 0:13:10,833
[squish]


389
0:13:10,833 --> 0:13:12,633
At least it can't
get any worse.


390
0:13:12,633 --> 0:13:14,800
How many times have
I told you not to say that?


391
0:13:14,800 --> 0:13:16,733
Now something worse
is gonna happen,


392
0:13:16,733 --> 0:13:18,333
I've seen it
on Happy Days, watch:


393
0:13:18,333 --> 0:13:19,333
In three,


394
0:13:19,333 --> 0:13:20,333
two,


395
0:13:20,333 --> 0:13:21,333
one.


396
0:13:21,333 --> 0:13:22,800
Abe.


397
0:13:22,800 --> 0:13:25,467
I'm really confused about
my feelings right now.


398
0:13:25,467 --> 0:13:27,333
I think I just...


399
0:13:27,333 --> 0:13:28,700
need some time
to be alone...

401
0:13:30,267 --> 0:13:31,300

402
0:13:32,800 --> 0:13:33,900
Wait.


403
0:13:33,900 --> 0:13:35,700
At least it can't
get any better.


404
0:13:35,700 --> 0:13:37,333
It doesn't work
that way, Gandhi.


405
0:13:38,667 --> 0:13:41,300

408
0:13:48,900 --> 0:13:54,200
* And the mind in my heart
has been wishing *

0:13:54,200 --> 0:13:55,733
*


410
0:13:55,733 --> 0:13:56,733
Abe?


411
0:13:56,733 --> 0:13:58,267
What are you
doing here?


412
0:13:58,267 --> 0:14:00,667
I come out here
to think sometimes.


413
0:14:00,667 --> 0:14:01,900
Me too.


414
0:14:01,900 --> 0:14:03,467
Well, right now all
I can think about


415
0:14:03,467 --> 0:14:05,633
is not thinking about you over
there on your thinking dock


416
0:14:05,633 --> 0:14:06,900
thinking about
what you did.


417
0:14:06,900 --> 0:14:09,067
I was only trying
to help, Abe.


418
0:14:09,067 --> 0:14:10,767
You don't know
what you're getting into.


419
0:14:10,767 --> 0:14:12,567
What she's
getting you into.


420
0:14:12,567 --> 0:14:14,533
You don't know what
you're getting into.


421
0:14:14,533 --> 0:14:16,867
And that's out of
my friendship.


422
0:14:16,867 --> 0:14:19,067
And you know what
hurts the most, Joan?


423
0:14:19,067 --> 0:14:20,400
This nail I just
stepped on.


424
0:14:20,400 --> 0:14:21,733
[ding]


425
0:14:21,733 --> 0:14:23,733
But there's a metaphorical nail
in my other foot


426
0:14:23,733 --> 0:14:24,933
that hurts the second most,


427
0:14:24,933 --> 0:14:26,667
and it's from you
backstabbing me.


428
0:14:26,667 --> 0:14:28,533
So, maybe instead of
the nail metaphor,


429
0:14:28,533 --> 0:14:30,300
I should've used
a stabbing metaphor,


430
0:14:30,300 --> 0:14:31,967
but it's too late for that now,
isn't it?


431
0:14:31,967 --> 0:14:33,367
I guess it is.


432
0:14:33,367 --> 0:14:35,600
That's where you're wrong, Joan.


433
0:14:35,600 --> 0:14:37,067
Because I'm gonna win
that election


434
0:14:37,067 --> 0:14:38,767
with the most
dangerous campaign stunt


435
0:14:38,767 --> 0:14:41,267
since Dukakis jumped
the Snake River Canyon.


436
0:14:41,267 --> 0:14:43,667
Goodbye, Joan.

0:15:00,333 --> 0:15:02,067
X-Stream Blu presents:

0:15:02,067 --> 0:15:04,967
the X-Stream Blu high school

Marilyn Manson,

Murray T. Wayans.

And now, he risks his ass
to thrill his class:


450
0:15:16,667 --> 0:15:19,833
Abe Lincoln.

0:15:19,833 --> 0:15:20,833

And on this podium,
captain of the football team


459
0:15:33,100 --> 0:15:37,100
and el capitán
of the fútbol team,


460
0:15:37,100 --> 0:15:39,733
JFK.

I can't see

Mena Suvari's enormous forehead.

(Manson)
Next question is for JFK.


466
0:15:49,900 --> 0:15:52,067
How do you respond
to the criticism that,


467
0:15:52,067 --> 0:15:53,833
unlike Abe and myself,


468
0:15:53,833 --> 0:15:55,733
you won't put yourself
at risk of physical harm


469
0:15:55,733 --> 0:15:57,133
in order to gain approval?


470
0:15:57,133 --> 0:16:01,367
That is a good question,
scary androgynous white guy.


471
0:16:01,367 --> 0:16:05,067
And I would like to reply
by taking my shirt off.

[girls screaming]


473
0:16:06,400 --> 0:16:09,200
My bare-chested opponent
raises a good point,


474
0:16:09,200 --> 0:16:11,400
but he's avoiding the fact
that X-Stream Blu


475
0:16:11,400 --> 0:16:13,700
is mad-packed with all nine
essential nutri-mites


476
0:16:13,700 --> 0:16:15,300
to fortify your X-Zone.


477
0:16:15,300 --> 0:16:17,233

May I respond to that?


478
0:16:17,233 --> 0:16:18,233
Yes, you may.


479
0:16:18,233 --> 0:16:19,633
Abe's a tot-muncher.

I'd like to dramatically gesture

It is my professional opinion
as a rock star


510
0:17:14,167 --> 0:17:15,367
and a licensed doctor,


511
0:17:15,367 --> 0:17:17,067

is suffering from

A shallow ploy by
Racist Mammy Breakfast Foods

I used to win your votes.

your votes.

Wait, everyone.


533
0:18:10,567 --> 0:18:12,267
You should vote for Abe,


534
0:18:12,267 --> 0:18:14,733
because a real leader does
what Abe just did,


535
0:18:14,733 --> 0:18:16,100

by the USDA *

are the foundation *
